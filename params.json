{"name":"Stock Portfolio Management Based On Machine Learning Model","tagline":"CS5600","body":"# Teaser\r\n\r\nStock price prediction has always been an interesting topic. Lots of studies are done in the area of application of machine learning techniques in stock market. This project studies portfolio management making profitable investment decisions based on Support Vector Machine algorithm as well as statistical regression analysis. \r\n\r\n# What\r\n\r\nThe study is conducted on a portfolio, which contains 10 stocks from oil sector. \r\nFixed amount of money is invested in these stocks. Price movement is being watched continuously. Trading strategy is as follows - when more than 2% increase is expecting for a stock, it indicates ‘buy’ and on the other hand, 2% decrease indicates ‘sell’.  All other cases, decision is to ‘keep’. \r\n\r\n10 years of historical data is collected for the selected stocks.  Data is divided into 6 years for training the model, 3 years for cross-validation and 1 year for testing the performance of the model developed. Hypothesis behind the experiment is that, previous 5 days contains some information on the next day’s stock price. So the data is preprocessed to extract the five days variables for a particular stock for a given date in one single record. The next step is feature selection. Intuitively, five days stock price, index and volume are considered as feature space.  Model which gives least training as well as cross-validation error is accepted for prediction. Performance of the model is tuned by varying the selection of features, kernels and parameters of the algorithm.\r\n\r\n# Why\r\n\r\nSVM are one of the powerful supervised learning algorithms, which can be used for classification as well as regression analysis. It constructs a hyperplane with larger minimum distance, called margin from any of the training examples. \r\nMultiple studies have been reported the feasibility of SVM in effectively predicting financial time series.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
